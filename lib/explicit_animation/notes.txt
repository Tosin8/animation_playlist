* Explicit animation involves an animation controller. 
* They start animating when they are explicitly asked to. 
* Being able to manage the lifecycle of the animation since it's not  a widget, putting it inside a stateful widget.

Ponder: 
 - Built-in explicit animation: usually called foo transition whose properties is the one being animated.
 - Custom explicit animation:  the decision to be a standalone widget or to be surrounded with another widgets. 
    - For standalone animation using 'AnimatedWidget' otherwise 'AnimatedBuilder'

    Having a performance problem using: CustomPainter - paint directly into the canvas, creating extremely performance effect.
